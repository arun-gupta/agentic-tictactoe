# Analysis Documentation

This directory contains analysis and planning documents that complement the main specification and implementation plan.

## Documents

- **test-coverage-analysis.md**: Analysis of test coverage and spec traceability across all implementation phases. Identifies which phases have explicit test coverage documentation and which need improvements.

## Purpose

Analysis documents provide:
- Detailed analysis of specific aspects of the project
- Traceability mapping between implementation phases and specifications
- Gap analysis and recommendations
- Planning and assessment documentation

These documents support the main documentation but are not part of the core specification.
