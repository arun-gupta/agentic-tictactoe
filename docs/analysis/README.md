# Analysis Documentation

This directory contains analysis and planning documents that complement the main specification and implementation plan.

## Documents

- **test-coverage-analysis.md**: Comprehensive analysis of test coverage and spec traceability across all 10 implementation phases. 
  - Identifies which phases have explicit test coverage documentation
  - Maps test files to spec sections
  - Provides recommendations for test coverage improvements
  - Documents 399+ acceptance criteria with full traceability

## Purpose

Analysis documents provide:
- **Detailed Analysis**: Deep dive into specific aspects of the project
- **Traceability Mapping**: Links between implementation phases and specification sections
- **Gap Analysis**: Identifies areas needing improvement or additional documentation
- **Planning & Assessment**: Supporting documentation for implementation planning

These documents support the main documentation but are not part of the core specification. They are useful for:
- Understanding test coverage across the project
- Planning implementation phases
- Ensuring compliance with specifications
- Identifying documentation gaps

## Usage

When starting implementation:
1. Review the test coverage analysis to understand testing requirements
2. Reference the traceability mappings when implementing each phase
3. Use gap analysis to identify areas needing additional work

## Structure

Analysis documents are organized by topic and updated as the project evolves. Each document includes:
- Summary of findings
- Detailed analysis sections
- Recommendations (if applicable)
- References to related specification sections
